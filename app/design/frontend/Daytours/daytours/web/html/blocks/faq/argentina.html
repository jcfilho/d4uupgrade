If you haven't decided on the specific dates you are going to stay in Buenos Aires, you can book a provisional date for the tour service you want (excluding tickets for football games or any other special events) and subsequently change it up to 3 days before the desired date via email with our Support Team."}}</p>

            <p class="answer">{{trans "You should receive an automatic response from our website confirming that your booking is in process. However, our Operations Team has to confirm this reservation with the tour provider, and, therefore, you should receive a second e-mail within 24 hours of your booking (up to 48 hours on weekends and national holidays) confirming the details of the service including pickup time, customer emergency number, and the voucher of your service. If you haven't received such an email, please check your junk folder or contact us via Chat to verify the status of your order."}}</p>

If your query does not require immediate attention, you should direct it to the Bsas4u Support Team and we will get back to you within the next 24 hours (up to 48 hours on weekends and national holidays)."}}</p>
